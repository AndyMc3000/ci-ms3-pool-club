The Cill na Martra Pool Club (hereafter called CPC) website is my Milestone 3 (MS3) project for the Diploma in Fullstack Software Development course at Code Institute. The underlying goal of the project is to meet and exceed the requirements laid out for the MS3 project by Code Institute. The high-level requirement of the MS3 project is to "..build a full-stack site that allows your users to manage a common dataset about a particular domain. Users make use of the site to share their own data with the community, and benefit from having convenient access to the data provided by all other members." 

This README refers to CPC as a fictional client of mine, where I have been hired to develop a website for CPC to meet certain criteria (see the User Experience Design section below). CPC is a small Pool Club with members based around a number of parishes close to Cill na Martra in Co.Cork, Ireland. Club members meet weekly at a number of local pubs to play pool. Membership numbers fluctuate between roughly 25 to 50 players. CPC runs a Pool League twice yearly. Members arrange to meet at a venue to play league matches, which comprise of playing the best out of 5 games format. A Referee must also be present at league matches. Any other member can referee a match.

Managing members and pool league data was traditionally paper-based, and was a headache for those members who were 'voluntold' to manage that job. The club want a simple web-based application to make it easy for members to; 
* Manage a league table.
* To allow members to get real-time match/league result information.
* To allow members to easily get contact information for players for the purpose of scheduling matches.

The principle languages used in the development of the site are; HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and Python.

Other technologies include; 
* The Bootstrap front-end CSS framework.
* The jQuery JavaScript library.
* The Flask Python web framework.
* The Jinja templating language for Python.
* The MongoDB NoSQL database program.
* The Heroku cloud Platform-as-a-Service.
* The EmailJS email service.

<hr>

The design of the CPC website was determined by assessing and quantifying the goals and objectives of the club organisers ('client stories'), as well as the requirements of players who will visit and use the site ('user stories'). Following the determination of client and user stories and their subsequent technical requirements, the site was designed using the principles of Jesse James Garrett's '5 Planes of UX Design'. The outcome or tasks created for each of the 5 design planes is outlinined below.

### 1. The Strategy Plane ###

The Strategy Plane, as defined by Jesse James Garrett "..incorporates not only what the people running the site want to get out of it but what the users want to get out of the site as well." 

Please see below details of the 'Client Stories' to detail the requirements of the Pary Chef business owner, and the 'User Stories' which highlight the requiremnts of end users of the Party Chef website.

#### Client Stories ####
> - [x] “The main goal of the website is to attract new business for Party Chef, and provide value to visitors in the information is provides.”
> - [x] “The website must show and promote the services which Party Chef provides.”
> - [x] “The website must detail the various menu's on offer, and the cost of food/drink items on each menu.” 
> - [x] “The website must allow people to easily contact Party Chef.”
> - [x] “The website must allow users to create their own menu from the menu items available, in order to get an idea of food/drinks costs for their party.”
> - [x] “The website must also allow users to request a quote, based on their MyMenu items and other relevant information about their event (Party Date, Party Location). The quote request information (including items in the active MyMenu list of menu items) should be sent by email to the business owner. A copy of the quote request should also be sent to the user.”
> - [x] “The website must allow users to find contact details for their local kitchen/office using an interactive Google Map (offices are called 'kitchens' on the site).”
> - [x] “The website must promote links to Party Chef's social media channels.”
> - [x] “The website must show photos of previous events.” 
> - [x] “The website must show customer testimonial quotes.”
> - [x] “The website must be mobile-friendly.”

#### User Stories ####
> - [x] “I want to see what kind of services Party Chef offers.”
> - [x] “I want to see what kind of menu's (food & drink) Party Chef offer.”
> - [x] “I want to find out where their 'kitchens' (offices) are located, and which is the closest office to me.”
> - [x] “I want to see photos of the dishes in Party Chef menu's.”
> - [x] “I want to see photos of previous events serviced by Party Chef.”
> - [x] “I want to be able to see pricing for menu items.”
> - [x] “I want to be able to create my own menu from the menu's of items offerred.”
> - [x] “I want to be able to send my menu along with details about my planned event to the Party Chef team in order to confirm their availability to service my event, and to get a detailed quote inclusive of all costs."
> - [x] “I want to be able to find links to the Party Chef social media channels.”


### 2. The Scope Plane ###

Based on the outcomes from the Strategy Plane, The Scope Plane determines what features, functionality, and types of content should be included within the scope of the project. Listed below are the functional specifications and content requirements decided upon for the Party Chef website. 

#### Functional Specifications: ####
* Build a responsive Website with 2 pages - a Homepage and a Contact page.
* Include a Navigation bar to highlight currently accessed page.
* Both pages should have a Jumbotron at the top of the page with relevant call-out messaging. The Homepage Jumbotron to include link to contact page in order to allow a user to find Party Chef contact details, and to send a query via a contact form.
* The Homepage should include a 'Features' section highlighting the Party Chef services.
* The Homepage should show various menu's (canpapes, starters, main course, something sweet, and drinks menus) each showing menu items listed within an accordian. 
* Shopping cart functionality should be built in so that menu items can be added to a 'MyMenu' list of items. The MyMenu should then be accessed via a button in the homepage Nav bar. Once clicked, the MyMenu list of items appears on a modal. Users can ammend quantites of the items they have selected in the MyMenu to get a total price for their food/drink selection. 
* The MyMenu should also have the facility to request a quote for an event/party. The request should include the food/drink items in a MyMenu list plus additional information about the event (date/time, location, etc.). The request will be sent to Party Chef by email. A copy of the request should also be sent to the user email address.
* The Homepage should include a Photo Gallery using a carousel to show dishes and menu items in party settings.
* The contact page must include all contact information for the Party Chef headquarters.
* The contact page should include an interactive map showing all the kitchen locations across Ireland. By implementing features of the Google Maps API, a user should be able to select an individual kitchen marker to get a pop-up of contact information for that particular kitchen.
* The contact page should also include a section highlighting social media channels.
* The contact page should also include a contact form so a user can ask a specific question of the Party Chef team.

#### Content Requirements: ####
* Both Jumbotrons should show images conveying people having fun at a party. Appropriate messaging should also be used to convey the key values of Party Chef.
* The features section on the Homepage should briefly, but completely, convey what the main services are and the the benefits of using them.
* Menu items should include a photo, a description, and the price per single serving of each item on the menus.
* Both photo galleries should show quality photos of impressive food layouts (Homepage Gallery) and recent events (Contact page gallery).
* Homepage should show the most glowing but brief Testimonial quotes along with the customer details.


### 3. The Structure Plane ###

#### Interaction Design: ####

Interaction design is defined as the "..development of application flows to facilitate user tasks, defining how the user interacts with site functionality". Inline with this principle, the pages were designed as follows;

1. The Homepage;
* It should have a navigation bar with individual links to each page and a 'MyMenu' modal. The navigation bar should also be fixed to the top of the page view.
* It should contain a call-to-action and button to allow a user to contact Party Chef. This should link to the contact page.
* It should contain a features/benefits section containing 4 principle features under the following rough heading titles; 'Who We Are', 'Our Services', 'Our Menu's', and 'What people say about us'.
* It should contain a list of menu's (each within its own accordion) under the following headings; 'Canapés', 'Starters', 'Main Course', 'Something Sweet', and 'Drinks'. 
* The menu accordions should contain a list of menu item to include a photo, description, and an 'Add to MyMenu' button. When the 'Add to MyMenu' button is clicked, an item is added to the users MyMenu (i.e. a shopping cart modal). 
* The users MyMenu (a modal) can be accessed by clicking on the MyModal button in the Nav bar. Within the MyMenu modal, a user can change the quantity of an item or remove an item.
* A user can also send a copy of the menu to Party Chef, along with additional information which must be included, in order to request a quote and confirm availablity. The extra information will come from a form in the MyMenu modal which a user must complete. The form will ask for; Name, Email, Telephone number, Party date, Party start time, Location, Service Type. A copy of the quote request will also be sent to the user by email.
* It should contain a gallery of photographs highlighting recent events and food displays.
* It should contain a section to show Testimonial quotes.
* It should have a further navigation section in the footer. The footer will also contain links to all Party Chef's social media channels.

2. The Contact page;
* It should have a navigation bar with individual links to each site page.
* It should contain a section to show the address and phone number of the Party Chef Headquarters.
* It should include a Google Map with markers to show the individual Party Chef offices around the country. And when a user clicks on a marker, and 'info window' should popup to show the contacts details and address for that office.
* It should also contain a contact form to allow a user to submit a query to Party Chef.

#### Information Architecture: ####

Information Architechture is defined as; "The structural design of the information space to facilitate intuitive access to content" (Copyright 2000 James Garrett). As such Party Chef was designed to allows a user to find the information they need easily. For example, the navigation bar is fixed to the top of the page view so is always immediately accessible, and buttons and links are clearly visible and communicate their purpose in an unambiguous way.

The structure of the website is outlined in the Sitemap. Click the link to view the <a href="readme-assets/cpc-sitemap.png"><strong>Sitemap.</strong></a>


### 4. The Skeleton Plane ###

Following on from the tasks decided upon in the Structure Plane, the Skeleton Plane is defined as follows; ".. The skeleton is designed to optimize the arrangement of these elements (such as the placement of buttons, tabs, photos's and blocks of text) for maximum effect and efficiency..".

With this in mind the following wireframes were created to detail the layput of the website pages and individual sections/containers. Please click the following links to view these wireframes.

1. <a href="assets/readme-assets/cpc-wireframes.png"><strong>Large Screen Wireframes</strong></a>

### 5. The Surface Plane ###

Having completed the previous 4 stages in the UX design process, I moved on to making decisions around the design and styling of the website. The Surface Plane focuses on the styling of images, backgrounds, fonts, and colours used on a website. The details of these decisions are listed here;

1. Colours - The color scheme for the website was chosen from a selection of colours I considered using tools on the [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) website. The color schemes chosen, along with their HEX values, is shown here;
<img src="assets/readme-assets/party-chef-coolors-pallette.png" width="450">

1. Font - I used the Google Fonts website to help me decide on a font to use. I wanted something simple yet modern at the same time - not too bold, and something a little different. I decided upon a font called 'Blinker' for headings, and the 'Montserrat' font for paragraph texts. An example of these fonts can be seen here;   
<img src="assets/readme-assets/party-chef-google-fonts-blinker.png" width="220">
<img src="assets/readme-assets/party-chef-google-fonts-montserrat.png" width="220">

1. Logo Design - I created the Party Chef logo using tools on [FreeLogoDesign.com](https://www.freelogodesign.org/).

1. Images - I mainly used photos taken from the [Unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/) website. On Unspalsh.com I was able to create a collection of relevant phtotos. The naming convention for each photograph includes a referenece to the photographer name and the Unsplash item code. The Alt attribute for each photograph also includes the photographer name.

1. Icons;
    * I used [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons to add icons to section headings. 
    * I created and added a Party Chef Favicon to the page headers.
    * I used [Flaticon](https://favicon.io/) icons for the social media section on contact.html.

1. Gallery - I decided to use a Bootstrap Modal as a container for my Carousel Gallery.

## 3. <a name="development-process">Development Process</a> ##
#### <br> ####
<hr>

I drew up a process to follow for developing the Party Chef website. This is listed in sequence below.

1. Design - I firstly designed the site based on the Client/User Stories requirements, and by creating wireframes/sketches.
2. Structure - I then wrote the HTML code for all pages including; navigation, footers, sections, modal gallery, forms, and Google Maps section.
3. Interactive Functionality - I added in any JavaScript elements to the site. Those being; the Google Maps API for a map with custom markers and 'infoWindows'.    A JavaScript Shopping Cart plugin. JavaScript to send form data via email using the EmailJS service. And Bootstrap JavaScript to manage form validation.
4. Content - I then added text content to sections (lorem ipsum/placeholder text), and images to galleries. 
5. Style - I then added colours and fonts and wrote CSS rule sets and media queries in order to style the website and make it responsive.
6. Responsive - I made sure all texts/headings, images, and container elements transform approprately and look good when viewed on different devices such as:        mobile phones, tablets, laptops, large screen PC's, and large TV's. 
7. Review - I did a last review of all code (formatting, beautifying etc) and content, fixing anys bugs/typo's etc as I did so.
8. Testing - I validated my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code, and tested functionality of site elements across a range of different devices and browsers. I then fixed any bugs found.

<img src="assets/readme-assets/technologies-used-logos-readme.png" width="330">

I used the following technologies, services, and devices to develop, style, deploy, and test the Pary Chef website;
<br>
* HTML5 - The site was developed using HTML5 markup language.
* CSS3 - The site was styled and in some cases made responsive using CSS3.
* JavaScript - Used for MyMenu functionality, Google Map, and EmailJS service.
* Bootstrap - I used the Bootstrap framework for implementing some sections and features of the website.
* EmailJS - I used the EmailJS email service to send Form and MyMenu list data by email to users and to Party Chef.
* GitHub - I set up a free repository on GitHub.com to maintain a master of all website files, content, and resources.
* GitPod - I used the free GitPod.io Integrated Development Environment to write and develop the code for the website.
* Github Pages - I used the free GitHub Pages hosting service to deploy/publish the live website on the internet.
* Balsamiq - I used the Balsamiq application to create the website sitemap and webpage wireframes.
* W3C validators - I used the W3C HTML5 and CSS3 code validators to validate my HTML and CSS.
* JSHint - I used jshint.com to validate my JavaScript code.
* Responsive Viewer - I used a Chrome Browser Extension called Responsive Viewer to emulate the presentation of the website on multiple device sizes and types.
* AmIResponsive - I used the [AmIResponsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) webpage to view site responsiveness across devices.

#### Bugs Discovered / Remedies ####
1. Issues remained with the functionality of forms when they are not completed in full. These validation erros have now been resolved with help from Tutor support.
2. Issues remained with multiple alerts appearing when a product is removed from the MyMenu. This has now been resolved with help from my Mentor, Rueben Ferrante.
3. The contact forms don't clear their contents once the send buttons are sent. This has now been resolved with help from my Mentor, Rueben Ferrante.
4. The JavaScript code was not commented fully. This has been resolved.
5. The Google Chrome Dev Tools console logs a warning which reads: 'Error with Permissions-Policy header: Unrecognized feature: 'interest-cohort'.' I found from a thread on StackOverflow that this relates to a "new header used to block Google's new tracking technology called Federated Cohorts of Learning (FLoC)." I then found that GitHub has added this new permission policy header to all pages. As such the warning is not within my control to fix as my site is deployed on GitHub Pages.

This site was developed by firstly setting up a GitHub repository to store the website files. GitHub is a free online code hosting platform for websites or web applications, which enables version control and collaboration during the development of a project. A repository on GitHub containes all of a project's files and each file's revision history. You can learn more about GitHub and repositories here: [Click here to go to GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github)

I then used the online GitPod Integrated Development Environment (or GitPod IDE) to write the code for the website. Once I was happy with a section of new code I commited or saved that to a staging area. Then, on a regular basis, I commited changes to the working version of the website on GitPod. These commits included a short description of what the changes do. I would then 'push' those changes from the GitPod IDE to my GitHub repository where the master set of files was updated. You can learn more about GitPod here: [Click here to go to GitPod](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github)

Early on in the development process I also deployed the website to a live web address using Heroku. Heroku is a container-based cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS). Developers use Heroku to deploy, manage, and scale modern apps. The Heroku platform is elegant, flexible, and easy to use, offering developers an easy path to getting their apps to market. Once setup, any changes I made on my GitPod IDE (and which were subsequently 'pushed' to my GitHub repository), were automatically pushed to my Heroku app.

The CPC site uses the Flask Python framework, a MongoDB database, a GitHub repository (including a main Python application file), and the Heroku platform. I had to ensure that all these components worked in sync in order to deploy the site successfully.

Here are the steps I took to deploy the website on Heroku;

**** Create a MongoDB Database ****

1. Create free account
1. Created new DB on MongoDB, and 
1. added there collections - league, users, matches.
1. Steps...

**** Install Flask & add additional files ****

1. Withiin The GitPod IDE terminal window Installed Flask
1. added app.py and env.py files
1. Added environment variable to app.py, 
1. imported Flask and tested Flask app is working by outputting Hello World to GitPod preview browser. 
1. Add requirements.txt
1. Add Procfile for Heroku

**** Create app on Heroku ****

1. Created App on Heroku - added config vars, and enabled automatic deploys from my GitHub repository (the Master branch). Tested and got Hello World! as expected.

**** Final Steps ****

1. Connected app to Mongodb 
1. Added flask_pymongo, bson.objectid 
1. Tested connection by adding route and 
2. code to add template for player_home.html, and which found the collection user and returned it to the page. Worked as expected.

I deployed the website early on in the development process, as it useful to be able to examine the website on various physical devices in its live state. Also, while the GitPod IDE has the ability to show a preview of real-time changes to a project, sometimes that does not pick up or display issues which would appear on the live site. By having the deployed site up and running during development, I was able to address and correct any bugs early in the development process.

The live version of the CPC website deployed via Heroku can be seen here: [UPDATE ME!](https://andymc3000.github.io/ci-ms2-party-chef/)

1. Coding Websites - I regularly used website to help me learn how to code certain elements/features. I also copied code snippets from these sites in some cases. These websites include; 
* [W3Schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/)
* [Mozilla MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
* [GitHub.com](https://github.com/)
* [StackOverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/)
* [CSSTricks.com](https://css-tricks.com/)

1. BBC Good Food webite - I copied the images and descriptions for 50 dishes on the BBC Good Food website to poulate the different menus on the Party Chef homepage. I edited some of the text descriptions but didn't edit any of the images. I did prefix each image filename with a number, but otherwise the filename is as the BCC Good Food website named them. Learn about the BBC Good Food website here: [BBC Good Food](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/)

1. Javascript Shoping Cart Plugin -  I used a Javascript plugin for the MyMenu feature on Party Chef. This was copied from code supplied by a GitHub user called WebDevSimplified who offers online coding course on YouTube. See that users profile here: [WebDevSimplified](https://github.com/WebDevSimplified). See the code repository for this plugin here: [Introduction to JavaScript Lesson 1](https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/Introduction-to-Web-Development/tree/master/Introduction%20to%20JavaScript/Lesson%201).

1. jQuery code used to stop Bootstrap form validation after a form was submitted in emailjs-contact-page-contact-form.js - I had a bug with form submission where Bootstrap validated the form again after 'submit' and 'reset'. As the form had been reset, this resulted in validation errors appearing on the blank form. I found some jQuery code on a GitHub issues thread which fixed the problem when I applied the code to my EmailJS JavaScript file. This thread was owned by a GitHub user called Cina Saffary. See the GitHub thread here - ['Resetting form doesn't clear validation errors'](https://github.com/1000hz/bootstrap-validator/issues/68).

1. EmailJS code - I copied relevant JavaScript code from the EmailJS website in order to create my 2 JavaScript files which send the emails from the forms on inde.html and contact.html.

1. Google Map with custom markers and InfoWindows - I used a YouTube video to help with implementing the Google Map API and adding custom markers and InfoWindows. That video was created by Pradip Debnath. See Pradips GitHub profile here: [Pradip Debnath](https://github.com/itzpradip). See the YouTube video here: [Google Maps API Tutorial | Custom Marker Icon | Multiple Info Window](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xptz0GQ2DO4)

1. Colours - I used the Coolors.co website to help me decide on a colour scheme for the webite. This website allows you to create your own colour palettes or to use one of thiers. See more about the Coolors.co palette catalogue and tools here: [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/). 

1. Font - I used Google Fonts for the fonts on the website. See more at: [GoogleFonts.com](https://fonts.google.com/)

1. Icons - I used FontAwesome and Favicon for all icons on the website. See more at: [FontAwesome.com](https://fontawesome.com/)

1. Design Principles - The design of this website employed the principles of 'The 5 Planes of UX design', which was created by Jesse James Garrett in his book; The Elements of User Experience: User-centered Design for the Web (2002). See more at; [Jjg.net](http://www.jjg.net/elements/)
  
1. Company Logo - The Party Chef logo was created using tools on the FreeLogoDesign.org website. See more at; [FreeLogoDesign.org](https://www.freelogodesign.org/)

1. Wikimedia commons - Technology logo's.
