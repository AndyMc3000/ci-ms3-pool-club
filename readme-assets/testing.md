## 1. <a name="development-testing">Development Testing</a> ##

During the development process I manually tested elements, components, and functions after I added them to the website. If I encountered an issue or bug, in most cases I worked to resolve it straight away. 

I have listed the tests I did including those where I encountered bugs here (mostly these are in date order, but some tests would have been done at several different times during development;

#### Tests ####

* Tested deployed app. The first thing I did was to setup my development environment and deploy an app on Heroku. To do this I created a GitHub repository using the Code Institute template. I then used GitPod as my IDE for the project. I created the following files; index.html, app.py, env.py, requirements.txt and a Procfile on GitPod. I then installed Flask, PyMongo, and dnspython. I then created a new database in MongoDB Atlas, created a collection in that, and connected that database to my main application file (app.py). I then created a new app on Heroku adding my environment variables, while also setting up automatic deployment when updates were pushed to my GitHub repository. I then used Flask to create a base.html file, along with a new template/view (index.html). I also added a python function to that view to call data from my test collection on MongoDB. When I commited and pushed my changes, and refreshed my Heroku app url, the required data was listed on the page as expected. 
* README links and images test. I also began writing up my README.md file around this time, and over time would update my README with content and files etc. I created a folder called readme-assets and added any images or files I wanted to include in my README to it. These files included a header logo, an image showing a screenshot of the site on multiple devices, and images showing the site colours, site fonts, and logo's for the technologies used. The README also contains links to a Sitemap image, and six different wireframe images. It also contains a link to this testing document. Once I added any files or links to my README I tested them to ensure that they presented or worked as expected. All worked as expected.
* Added a Bootstrap Navigation bar to base.html, complete with Club logo linking to index.html, along with navigation links to Home (index.html), Log In (login.html), and Register (register.html). I tested all links and they worked as expected.
* Created a footer on base.html to include a club logo linking to index.html. I tested it and it worked as expected.
* Added Bootstrap (CSS and JavaScript), FontAwesome, and jQuery CDN links, as well as static files for my JavaScript and CSS files. I tested that the stylesheets are being target corrected by adding content etc. They worked as expected.
* Added a carousel at the bottom of base.html for sponsor banners. Each banner links to an external website. I tested that functionality and it worked as expected.
* Added a login.html page, and added login functionality in app.py. Once logged in a user should be taken to their Player Homepage. I tested this and it worked as expected.
* Added additional Nav bar links to navbar on base.html. These new links link to 'MyHome' (player-home.html), 'Log Out' (I added a logout function in app.py), and 'Admin' (admin-home.html. Using Jinja2 I restricted the visibility of these links to registered users. I tested the Log Out link and it functioned as expected (I was redirected to the login.html with a flash message to say I had successfully been logged out).
* Added a carousel to the top of index.html for 'hero images' and promotional messaging. The carousel slides include a button which link to the registration page using the Jinja2 tempalting language(register.html). I tested the carousel functionality and the button links and all worked as expected.
* Added a button to the introduction section on index.html which links a user to the registration page. I tested it and it worked as expected.
* Added 'Current League' button to the 'Our Leagues' section on index.html which links a user to the active league Table. I tested it and it worked as expected
* Added 'Contact Us' form to index.html. Using the EmailJS email service, this form can be used to send a message to Club organisers. A user would also receive an email by way of confirmation that their message had been received by the club. I setup an EmailJS template and added the required JavaScript to my script.js file. I also added Bottstrap form validation JavaScript for all forms to script.js. Once everything was in place I tested the system and it worked as expected.
* Created templates for 'Player Home' and 'Admin Home' and added cards for each view linked from those pages. Each card has a button which links to the relevant template view. I tested these and all worked as expected.
* Created templates for all required pages. Added 'Back' buttons to the top and bottom of these pages. Tested all and all worked as expected.
* Exception Handling. I added to Python functions to my app.py file to manage any erros which may happen while a usr is using the site. One function manages 404/'Page not Found' type erros, and the other manages all other exceptions/errors. In both cases a user should be directed to one of two pages which explain that an error occurred and which offer a button to direct a user back to the Homepage. I test this cand it worked as expected.
* Python and JavaScript functions testing are detailed under the Manual Testing section below.

## 2. <a name="user-client-stories-testing">User & Client Stories Testing</a> ##

I tested each of the Client and User stories which were used to determine the features, functions and styling of the CPC website. See the results of these tests here; 

#### Client Stories ####
> - [x] “One of the main goals of the website is to grow the membership of Cill na Martra Pool Club, and to provide value to visitors in the information is provides about the CPC.” - TEST RESULT: The site describes what the club is, what the benefits are of being a member, and how leagues operate.

## 3. <a name="code-validation">Code Validation</a> ##

I ran the website through the W3C validators for [HTML](https://validator.w3.org/) and [CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). I also ran my JavaScript & jQuery code through the [JSHint.com](https://jshint.com/) code checker, and used the PEP8 checker at [PEP8online.com](http://pep8online.com/) to check my Python code for PEP8 compliance.  

#### HTML ####

The W3C CSS Validation Service. The validator highlighted the following warning for index.html. No other errors or warnings were found.

* "Warning: Section lacks heading. Consider using h2-h6 elements to add identifying headings to all sections." - I decide not to 'fix' the issue this warning relates to. It relates to the title of the introduction section which is a h1 title. I decide to leave it as a h1 as it looks better like this when underneath the 'hero' carousel.

#### CSS ####

The W3C CSS Validation Service. The validator found the following errors. No toher warnings or erros were found.

* The validator highlighted 18 Errors and 768 Warnings relating to the bootstrap.min.css style sheet. I queried this with Tutor Support and was advised that these were acceptable issues as I have no control over the CDN-delivered Bootstrap style sheet.

#### JavaScript & jQuery ####

I ran my script.js file through the JSHint validator and foucn the following Warnings. No errors were found.

* Eight warnings - the following show the line number of the warning and the warning description;
18	Missing semicolon.
21	Missing semicolon.
28	Missing semicolon.
29	Missing semicolon.
32	Missing semicolon.
33	Missing semicolon.
34	Missing semicolon.
35	Missing semicolon.

* One undefined variable
63	emailjs

* The warnings described relate to the Bootstrap from validation JavaScript. When I attempted to resolve these warnings, by adding semicolon's in the relvant places, it broke the form validation feature. As a result I reverted to the otiginal Bootstrap code.
* I also left the EmailJS variable warning 'as is', as I couldn't find a fix for it and didn't wntn to break the Contact Us Form EmailJS feature. 

#### Python ####

I ran my app.py file through the PEP8online.com Python validator and found the following Error. 

* Error Code	Line	Column	Text
* E128	      89	  13	    continuation line under-indented for visual indent

I fixed this error by continuing the relevant line of code onto the next line in app.py. I then repeated the test and got an 'All right' messgae from the validator.

## 6. <a name="bugs-discovered">Bugs Discovered / Remedies</a> ##

While developing and testing the site I discovered the below bugs/issues. If I founc a remedy to a bug I have listed this below.

#### Bugs Discovered / Remedies ####
1. Bootstrap form validation - When I tried to validate the JavaScript code I got from Bootsrap on JSHint.com, it thrw back warnings saying the code was missing semi-colons. So, I added them to my code. However this stopped the vaidation so I had to revert to the original code.
1. CSS animation error - I added the animation property to my style.css along with the required vendor prefixes and @keyframe syntax. When I ran my code through the W3 Jigsaw validator, it threw errors for my animation code. I did some research and it seems that W3/CSS specification don't yet recognise vendor prefixes. As such I removed the animation code to ensure I ran no errors.
1. Bootstrap CSS errors. When I ran my site through the W3 Jigsaw CSS validator it through multiple warnings and erros for the Bootstrap CDN-linked CSS file in my base.html. I discussed this with Student Support and was advised that as it was a Bootstra file (and I have no control over it), it was acceptable to leave this as is. 
1. EMailJS Console error - The EmailJS JavaScript code produces and 'AddEventListener' error in the console. I didn't have time to find a solution to this.
1. HTML validator warning - The W3 HTML validator produced a Warning in regard to a section not having an accetable heading. It relates to the Introduction section on index.html. I decided to leave this issue as is, as it looks better on the page to have a H1 there instead of a H2 to H6 version of the text.
1. Floating Footer - When I initally created my base.html and index.html templates and added a navbar and footer, the footbar did not behave itself. It was 'floating' up from the bottom of the page and hugging the bottom of the last container on the page. I did some research and found that I could fix it by applying some CSS to it. I added the 'Margin-Top: auto' property and value and it fixed the issue.
1. On a previous project I had a bug with form submission where Bootstrap was validating a contact form after it had been 'submit' and 'reset'. As the form had been reset, this resulted in Bootstrap validation errors appearing on the blank form after form submission. This may give a user the impression that their message/form had not been sent, even though an Alert had been sent to the browser to confirm that the message had been sent. This is a known issue with Bootstrap. With help from Tutor support and a Google search I found some jQuery code on a GitHub chat thread which fixed the problem. When I added the code to my EmailJS JavaScript code on script.js it fixed the problem. See that GitHub thread here - ['Resetting form doesn't clear validation errors'](https://github.com/1000hz/bootstrap-validator/issues/68). 
1. Safari datepicker. I found that Safari does not HTML datepicker. I found a jQuery-based solution on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35682138/html5-date-picker-doesnt-show-on-safari), but didn't have time to implement/test it.
