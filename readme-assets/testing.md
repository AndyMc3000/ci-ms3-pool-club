## 1. <a name="development-testing">Development Testing</a> ##

During the development process I manually tested elements, components, and functions after I added them to the website. If I encountered an issue or bug, in most cases I worked to resolve it straight away. 

I have listed the tests I did including those where I encountered bugs here (mostly these are in date order, but some tests would have been done at several different times during development;

#### Tests ####

* Tested deployed app. The first thing I did was to setup my development environment and deploy an app on Heroku. To do this I created a GitHub repository using the Code Institute template. I then used GitPod as my IDE for the project. I created the following files; index.html, app.py, env.py, requirements.txt and a Procfile on GitPod. I then installed Flask, PyMongo, and dnspython. I then created a new database in MongoDB Atlas, created a collection in that, and connected that database to my main application file (app.py). I then created a new app on Heroku adding my environment variables, while also setting up automatic deployment when updates were pushed to my GitHub repository. I then used Flask to create a base.html file, along with a new template/view (index.html). I also added a python function to that view to call data from my test collection on MongoDB. When I commited and pushed my changes, and refreshed my Heroku app url, the required data was listed on the page as expected. 
* README links and images test. I also began writing up my README.md file around this time, and over time would update my README with content and files etc. I created a folder called readme-assets and added any images or files I wanted to include in my README to it. These files included a header logo, an image showing a screenshot of the site on multiple devices, and images showing the site colours, site fonts, and logo's for the technologies used. The README also contains links to a Sitemap image, and six different wireframe images. It also contains a link to this testing document. Once I added any files or links to my README I tested them to ensure that they presented or worked as expected. All worked as expected.
* Added a Bootstrap Navigation bar to base.html, complete with Club logo linking to index.html, along with navigation links to Home (index.html), Log In (login.html), and Register (register.html). I tested all links and they worked as expected.
* Created a footer on base.html to include a club logo linking to index.html. I tested it and it worked as expected.
* Added Bootstrap (CSS and JavaScript), FontAwesome, and jQuery CDN links, as well as static files for my JavaScript and CSS files. I tested that the stylesheets are being target corrected by adding content etc. They worked as expected.
* Added a carousel at the bottom of base.html for sponsor banners. Each banner links to an external website. I tested that functionality and it worked as expected.
* Added a login.html page, and added login functionality in app.py. Once logged in a user should be taken to their Player Homepage. I tested this and it worked as expected.
* Added additional Nav bar links to navbar on base.html. These new links link to 'MyHome' (player-home.html), 'Log Out' (I added a logout function in app.py), and 'Admin' (admin-home.html. Using Jinja2 I restricted the visibility of these links to registered users. I tested the Log Out link and it functioned as expected (I was redirected to the login.html with a flash message to say I had successfully been logged out).
* Added a carousel to the top of index.html for 'hero images' and promotional messaging. The carousel slides include a button which link to the registration page using the Jinja2 tempalting language(register.html). I tested the carousel functionality and the button links and all worked as expected.
* Added a button to the introduction section on index.html which links a user to the registration page. I tested it and it worked as expected.
* Added 'Current League' button to the 'Our Leagues' section on index.html which links a user to the active league Table. I tested it and it worked as expected
* Added 'Contact Us' form to index.html. Using the EmailJS email service, this form can be used to send a message to Club organisers. A user would also receive an email by way of confirmation that their message had been received by the club. I setup an EmailJS template and added the required JavaScript to my script.js file. I also added Bottstrap form validation JavaScript for all forms to script.js. Once everything was in place I tested the system and it worked as expected.
* Created templates for 'Player Home' and 'Admin Home' and added cards for each view linked from those pages. Each card has a button which links to the relevant template view. I tested these and all worked as expected.
* Created templates for all required pages. Added 'Back' buttons to the top and bottom of these pages. Tested all and all worked as expected.

## 2. <a name="user-client-stories-testing">User & Client Stories Testing</a> ##

I tested each of the Client and User stories which were used to determine the features, functions and styling of the CPC website. See the results of these tests here; 

#### Client Stories ####

## 3. <a name="code-validation">Code Validation</a> ##

I ran the website through the W3C validators for [HTML](https://validator.w3.org/) and [CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). I also ran my JavaScript code through the [JSHint.com](https://jshint.com/) code checker, and used the PEP8 checker at [PEP8online.com](http://pep8online.com/) to check my Python code for PEP8 compliance.  

#### HTML ####

The validator highlighted the followings errors across index.html and contact.html.

* The aria-controls attribute must point to an element in the same document.
* The aria-describedby attribute must point to an element in the same document.
* The aria-describedby attribute must point to an element in the same document.
* Illegal character in path segment: space is not allowed.
* An img element must have an alt attribute, except under certain conditions.
* Element h3 not allowed as child of element span in this context. 
* Attribute row not allowed on element div at this point.

All errors were fixed by making neccessary changes.

#### CSS ####

The W3C CSS Validation Service

The validator highlighted the following errors in style.css;

* 44	.close:hover	Parse Error (1.3)
* 51	.close i:hover	Parse Error (1.3)
* 176	.btn-danger:hover	Parse Error (1.2)
* 275	.navbar button:hover	Parse Error (1.2)
* 357	.button.nav-link.mymenu:hover	Parse Error (1.2)

All errors were fixed by making necessary changes.

The validator also highlighted 2 x Errors and 768 x Warnings relating to the bootstrap.min.css style sheet. I queried this with Student support and was advised that as I have no control over the Bootstrap style sheet as I am using a CDN to access the file, these were acceptable issues.

#### JavaScript ####

I ran the following files though the JSHint validator;

store.js
maps.js
emailjs-homepage-request-a-quote.js
emailjs-contact-page-contact-form.js
bootstrap-form-validation.js

Once I configued the validator to accept jQuery and JavaScript ES6, no Errors were listed.

#### Python ####
